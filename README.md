# Expense Tracker

This project was built as part of the course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). I have added the ability to set a budget for a particular year to the app.

## Scripts

Run the development server:

    npm start

Build for production:

    npm build
